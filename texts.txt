Barbara Oakleyâ€™s story. 

Math didn't come naturally to Barbara in childhood. She thought of herself as more of a 
humanities person, and not a brilliant one at that. With an eye to becoming a linguist, after 
school she enlisted in the army, who sent her to learn Russian. After several years of service, 
during which she rose to the rank of Captain, Barbara left the army and decided to study 
engineering. In was during this time that she developed her learning methodology as she was 
forced to reprogram her brain for a different kind of learning. It turns out that when something 
doesn't come naturally to you, having to work hard to gain the knowledge that other people 
may get at first glance gives you a deeper, more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.
