                Whether it's at school or university, the one thing no one ever
                teaches you is how to teach yourself. All you actually do is
                memorize information in order to regurgitate when you take the
                test. You get drilled on how to solve specific exercises so that
                while you know exactly what you need to do when exam time comes
                around, do you truly understand the subject material? All you've
                really learned is how to pass that one test. Once that test is
                over, the information in your head has outlived its usefulness.

                Knowing how to study is absolutely essential, but for some
                reason, this point is too often overlooked. So, what can we do
                to remedy this?

              <p class="two-columns__paragraph">
                There are certain techniques and exercises that can be applied
                to the learning process to help make it more efficient and
